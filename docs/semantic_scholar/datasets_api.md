S2AG Datasets (1.0)
Download OpenAPI specification:Download

Download full-corpus datasets from the Semantic Scholar Academic Graph (S2AG)

Some python demonstrating usage of the datasets API:

r1 = requests.get('https://api.semanticscholar.org/datasets/v1/release').json()
print(r1[-3:])
['2023-03-14', '2023-03-21', '2023-03-28']

r2 = requests.get('https://api.semanticscholar.org/datasets/v1/release/latest').json()
print(r2['release_id'])
2023-03-28

print(json.dumps(r2['datasets'][0], indent=2))
{
    "name": "abstracts",
    "description": "Paper abstract text, where available. 100M records in 30 1.8GB files.",
    "README": "Semantic Scholar Academic Graph Datasets The "abstracts" dataset provides..."
}

r3 = requests.get('https://api.semanticscholar.org/datasets/v1/release/latest/dataset/abstracts').json()
print(json.dumps(r3, indent=2))
{
  "name": "abstracts",
  "description": "Paper abstract text, where available. 100M records in 30 1.8GB files.",
  "README": "Semantic Scholar Academic Graph Datasets The "abstracts" dataset provides...",
  "files": [

Download Links for a Dataset
Datasets are partitioned and stored on S3. Clients can retrieve them by requesting this list of pre-signed download urls and fetching all the partitions.

path Parameters
dataset_name
required
string
Name of the dataset

release_id
required
string
ID of the release

Responses
200 Description and download links for the given dataset within the given release

get
/release/{release_id}/dataset/{dataset_name}

Incremental Updates
Download Links for Incremental Diffs
Full datasets can be updated from one release to another to avoid downloading and processing data that hasn't changed. This method returns a list of all the "diffs" that are required to catch a given dataset up from its current release to a newer one.

Each "diff" represents changes between two sequential releases, and contains two lists of files, an "updated" list and a "deleted" list. Records in the "updated" list need to be inserted or replaced by their primary key. Records in the "deleted" list should be removed.

Example code for updating a database or key/value store:

difflist = requests.get('https://api.semanticscholar.org/datasets/v1/diffs/2023-08-01/to/latest/papers').json()
for diff in difflist['diffs']:
    for url in diff['update_files']:
        for json_line in requests.get(url).iter_lines():
            record = json.loads(json_line)
            datastore.upsert(record['corpusid'], record)
    for url in diff['delete_files']:
        for json_line in requests.get(url).iter_lines():
            record = json.loads(json_line)
            datastore.delete(record['corpusid'])
Example code for updating via a join in Spark:

current = sc.textFile('s3://curr-dataset-location').map(json.loads).keyBy(lambda x: x['corpusid'])
updates = sc.textFile('s3://diff-updates-location').map(json.loads).keyBy(lambda x: x['corpusid'])
deletes = sc.textFile('s3://diff-deletes-location').map(json.loads).keyBy(lambda x: x['corpusid'])

updated = current.fullOuterJoin(updates).mapValues(lambda x: x[1] if x[1] is not None else x[0])
updated = updated.fullOuterJoin(deletes).mapValues(lambda x: None if x[1] is not None else x[0]).filter(lambda x: x[1] is not None)
updated.values().map(json.dumps).saveAsTextFile('s3://updated-dataset-location')
