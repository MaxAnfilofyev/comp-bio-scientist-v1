## TL;DR

Why do substantia nigra neurons die in Parkinson’s while neighboring VTA neurons survive? A minimal energetic model shows that extreme axonal and calcium loads push SNc neurons into a bistable “metabolic trap,” where physiological noise can trigger irreversible collapse.

## Abstract

Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are selectively vulnerable in Parkinson’s disease, while closely related neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are comparatively spared. Mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium stress, dopamine oxidation, and $\alpha$-synuclein aggregation have all been implicated, but none alone explains why anatomically similar populations experience such different fates—or why disease progression features a long prodromal phase followed by rapid, largely irreversible decline.

Here we develop a minimal two-variable energetic model that captures mitochondrial functional capacity ($M$), energetic reserve ($E$), and the combined load from axonal arborization ($A$) and calcium pacemaking burden ($C$). We show that when cooperative mitochondrial amplification is included, increasing structural and calcium load drives the system through a load-induced saddle-node bifurcation, creating a bistable regime in which a healthy high-energy state coexists with a collapsed low-energy state. Using anatomical reconstructions of nigrostriatal neurons to calibrate $A$ and physiological data on pacemaking to calibrate $C$, we find that VTA neurons reside in a deep monostable “safe” regime, whereas SNc neurons lie inside a bistable band where the energetic basin is shallow. In this regime, physiologically plausible noise is sufficient to push SNc trajectories across the separatrix into a collapsed energetic attractor.

We further show that this collapse is locked in by hysteresis: once in the low-energy state, rescue would require reducing effective axonal load below the left saddle-node fold, corresponding to an anatomically implausible degree of pruning. Thus, under realistic constraints, energetic collapse becomes effectively irreversible. This topological perspective unifies selective SNc vulnerability, variable age of onset, and practical irreversibility as generic consequences of joint structural and metabolic load, reframing Parkinson’s disease as a problem of geometric “distance from a tipping point” in neuronal phase space rather than a purely molecular checklist.
