        "Title": "Percolation of Mitochondrial Failure: How Axonal Arbor Topology Drives Spatially Progressive Degeneration in Parkinson\u2019s Disease",
        "Short Hypothesis": "The long, highly branched axonal arbors of SNc dopaminergic neurons create a spatial network in which local mitochondrial dysfunction and limited mitochondrial transport can percolate, producing a topology-dependent tipping point for progressive, effectively irreversible energetic collapse; VTA neurons lie below this percolation threshold. This hypothesis can be tested using published morphological reconstructions, reported mitochondrial transport/turnover rates, and in silico compartmental simulations to show a transport-limited percolation transition distinct from simple single-cell bistability.",
        "Related Work": "Prior theoretical work has modeled energetic bistability and tipping points at the level of whole-cell energetics (e.g., saddle-node collapse due to load). Empirical literature documents SNc vulnerability, larger axonal arborization of SNc vs VTA neurons, calcium pacemaking burden, and deficits in mitochondrial transport/turnover in PD. However, existing models are (i) spatially lumped and ignore arbor topology and transport dynamics, or (ii) empirical studies report arbor metrics and transport kinetics without integrating them into a spatial failure propagation framework. This proposal differs by combining compartmental, topology-aware models of axonal arbors with published transport and mitophagy kinetics to ask whether a percolation-like phase transition (rather than only local bistability) explains progressive degeneration and the observed spatial patterns of axonal/somatic failure. It is not a trivial extension because percolation on a tree with transport constraints yields different thresholds, scaling laws, and intervention points than lumped bifurcation models.",
        "Abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are disproportionately lost in Parkinson\u2019s disease compared with neighboring ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. While mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium stress, and axonal load have all been implicated, existing models either treat each neuron as a spatially lumped energy unit or focus on molecular aggregation without integrating axonal geometry and mitochondrial transport. We propose that the spatial topology of long, highly branched axonal arbors converts local mitochondrial defects and transport limitations into a percolation-like failure mode: when effective mitochondrial supply and turnover fall below a topology-dependent threshold, local failures spread along the arbor as a cascade, producing progressive degeneration and apparent irreversibility at the cellular level. Leveraging published single-neuron reconstructions and reported mitochondrial transport, ATP diffusion, and mitophagy rates, we will build a compartmental model on realistic arbor graphs, include stochastic local failure events (e.g., damaged mitochondria accumulation, excessive local ATP demand from calcium or release), and analyze the conditions for percolation vs localized recovery. Mathematical analysis will identify scaling laws (how arbor size/branching shifts thresholds), critical nodes (bottlenecks), and intervention targets (transport enhancement, local demand suppression). The resulting theory predicts quantitative relations among arbor metrics, transport kinetics, and degeneration risk that can be tested against archival morphological and pathology datasets and suggests which cellular processes most effectively move neurons away from the tipping point.",

This \u2018allometric tipping\u2019 explains why SNc neurons (large A, high f) but not nearby VTA neurons collapse in Parkinson\u2019s disease, and it makes testable cross-species and intervention predictions that follow from published anatomical and physiological data.

Modeling studies (including lumped two-variable energetic bistability and the previously proposed arbor percolation models) have shown how load and nonlinear mitochondrial recovery can produce saddle-node collapse. However, prior work has either (i) focused on single-cell biophysics without explicit cross-species or lifespan scaling, or (ii) explored topology-dependent percolation on arbors. This proposal differs by integrating published morphological, electrophysiological, mitochondrial, and lifespan data across species into a unified allometric/bifurcation framework: we will derive scaling laws for demand (function of axon length and pacemaking frequency), impose empirically based models of age-related mitochondrial decline, and predict the age-dependent crossing of a saddle-node bifurcation. Unlike topology/percolation work, this project tests whether simple scaling and aging alone suffice to explain selective vulnerability and onset timing, yielding falsifiable cross-species predictions and concrete intervention effect sizes.",

Previous mechanistic hypotheses implicate axonal load, calcium pacemaking, and mitochondrial dysfunction, and separate modeling studies have shown that nonlinear mitochondrial dynamics can yield energetic bistability. Here we propose and test an alternative, complementary explanation: an allometric energetic tipping point set by axonal scale, pacemaking rate, and lifespan-driven mitochondrial decline. We assemble published single-neuron reconstructions, electrophysiological pacemaking statistics, mitochondrial density/turnover estimates, and species life-history data to parameterize a compact two-variable model (mitochondrial capacity M, energetic reserve E) where demand scales as Demand = k * A^alpha * f^beta. Age acts through an empirically grounded decline in M(t). Mathematical bifurcation analysis shows that for plausible scaling exponents and parameter ranges, SNc neurons lie closer to a saddle-node fold and will cross into a collapsed attractor at species-specific ages, while VTA neurons remain on the safe side. We validate predictions by mapping published morphological and physiological data from rodents and primates into the model, performing Monte Carlo uncertainty quantification, and comparing predicted onset ages or vulnerability rankings to reported patterns of dopaminergic loss and age of PD onset. The model yields testable quantitative predictions: how much reduction in firing rate, arbor effective length, or mitochondrial decline rate would delay tipping by decades, and which species or neuronal subtypes should be most vulnerable. This framework reframes PD risk as an allometric distance-to-tipping-point problem amenable to quantitative cross-species inference and intervention design.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "SNc vulnerability arises because a limited, shared proteostatic clearance capacity (autophagy/proteasome flux) must be dynamically allocated between mitochondrial quality control and clearance of misfolded/oxidized \u03b1\u2011synuclein/dopamine adducts. Cooperative aggregation of \u03b1\u2011synuclein increases its clearance cost nonlinearly and siphons proteostatic flux away from mitophagy, producing a load\u2011induced saddle\u2011node bifurcation in the joint (mitochondrial capacity, aggregate burden) state space. SNc neurons (high axonal/dopaminergic load) sit within the bistable band while adjacent VTA neurons lie in the monostable safe regime. This explanation differs from pure energetics/arbor topology models by explicitly modeling proteostatic allocation, aggregation cooperativity, and feedbacks between aggregates and mitochondrial turnover, all constrained by published aggregation and clearance kinetics. The question is best addressed computationally by integrating published rate constants and summary statistics into a low\u2011dimensional dynamical model and stochastic simulations\u2014wet lab experiments are not necessary to discover whether such an allocation tipping point can generically explain selective vulnerability and hysteresis.",

Other empirical literature implicates \u03b1\u2011synuclein aggregation, dopamine oxidation, and impaired mitophagy/autophagic flux in Parkinson's. However, these strands have not been combined into a minimal dynamical model of competition for limited proteostatic flux that (i) includes nucleation\u2011dependent aggregation kinetics (cooperativity), (ii) couples aggregate burden to mitochondrial damage rates, and (iii) examines how allocation dynamics produce topological features (bistability, hysteresis, stochastic escape) explaining selective SNc vulnerability. This proposal is not a trivial extension: allocation creates different bifurcation geometry and distinct intervention targets (increase global flux vs change allocation rules), and aggregation cooperativity yields a qualitatively different separatrix structure than purely load\u2011driven energetic collapse or arbor percolation.",

Energetic load, calcium stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and \u03b1\u2011synuclein aggregation have all been implicated, but the mechanistic coupling that makes SNc neurons uniquely fragile remains unclear. We propose a minimal, literature\u2011anchored dynamical model in which a limited cellular proteostatic clearance capacity (autophagy/proteasome flux) must be allocated between mitophagy (maintaining mitochondrial functional mass M) and clearance of misfolded/oxidized \u03b1\u2011synuclein and dopamine adducts (aggregate burden S). \u03b1\u2011Synuclein aggregation exhibits nucleation\u2011dependent cooperativity, so its effective clearance cost grows superlinearly with S; aggregates also increase mitochondrial damage rates, creating a positive feedback loop. Using published aggregation kinetics, mitophagy/proteasome flux estimates, and cell\u2011type differences in dopamine oxidation/axonal release as priors, we show mathematically and numerically that allocation competition generically produces a saddle\u2011node bifurcation: low aggregate/high mitochondrial states coexist with high aggregate/low mitochondrial states over a band of effective loads. SNc neurons map inside this bistable band; physiological noise or transient insults can stochastically drive them across the separatrix into an aggregate\u2011locked, mitochondria\u2011depleted state that is practically irreversible due to hysteresis. The model explains selectivity, variable age of onset, and why restoring proteostatic flux after collapse yields little rescue.

When local heteroplasmy crosses a critical threshold, cooperative loss of OXPHOS function produces an effective bistable collapse of energetic capacity. This stochastic, replication-dependent mutational tipping-point explains selective vulnerability of SNc (high pacemaking/calcium) vs VTA neurons (lower calcium) and the long prodromal phase followed by rapid decline. This question is best addressed computationally by combining published mtDNA mutation/replication parameters, mitochondrial turnover and transport data, and pacemaking statistics into stochastic, spatially resolved models\u2014wet lab work is not required to establish whether realistic parameter regimes produce age-like time-to-collapse distributions consistent with the literature.",
        "Related Work": "Empirically, high levels of mtDNA deletions and respiratory-chain\u2013deficient neurons have been reported in aged human SNc; models of clonal expansion of mtDNA deletions in post-mitotic cells (muscle, neurons) show stochastic drift and selection can produce focal high-heteroplasmy patches. Separately, SNc dopaminergic neurons are known to be autonomous pacemakers with prominent L-type calcium entry and a high calcium-handling burden that can drive mitochondrial biogenesis/turnover via calcium-sensitive signaling (PGC-1\u0003a1 pathways). Prior computational work on PD vulnerability has emphasized energetic load (axon arbor), percolation/transport limits, or proteostatic allocation, and some lumped energetic models show saddle-node collapse; however, none have explicitly modeled mtDNA mutation/replication dynamics driven by pacemaking-induced biogenesis and their stochastic clonal expansion across spatially distributed mitochondrial populations. This proposal differs meaningfully by linking calcium-driven replication frequency to mtDNA mutational dynamics and heteroplasmy threshold effects, yielding a distinct stochastic-tipping mechanism complementary to but different from load- or clearance-based bifurcations.",
        "Abstract": "Why do substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic neurons degenerate preferentially in Parkinson's disease while neighboring ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons are relatively spared? We propose a novel, literature-grounded computational hypothesis: autonomous calcium pacemaking in SNc neurons increases episodes of mitochondrial biogenesis/mtDNA replication, thereby elevating the effective mutation/replication burden and speeding clonal expansion of deletion-bearing mitochondrial genomes. Using stochastic models of mtDNA birth\u2013death with spatial compartments (soma and axonal segments) and published parameter ranges for mtDNA mutation rates, mtDNA copy numbers, turnover/mitophagy rates, mitochondrial transport, and SNc/VTA pacemaking statistics, we show that replication-driven stochasticity can produce long waiting times (a prodromal phase) followed by rapid, practically irreversible energetic collapse when local heteroplasmy crosses a cooperative OXPHOS-failure threshold. The tipping dynamics are shaped by mitochondrial mixing (transport), local turnover, and the sensitivity of biogenesis bursts to calcium transients. Mapping SNc- and VTA-derived parameter ensembles into the model predicts substantially higher collapse probabilities and earlier first-passage times in SNc-like neurons under physiologically plausible noise, matching qualitative features of age-dependent vulnerability. The model yields concrete, testable predictions about how reducing pacemaking calcium entry, lowering mtDNA replication frequency, or modestly increasing mitochondrial mixing delays collapse, and quantifies required effect sizes.

        "Short Hypothesis": "Selective vulnerability of SNc neurons arises not only from cell-autonomous energetic constraints but from overload of local astrocytic metabolic and antioxidant buffering: the dense dopaminergic terminal field and high dopamine oxidation in SNc impose a shared astrocytic demand (lactate supply + ROS detoxification) that, when coupled to age-dependent decline in astrocyte capacity, produces a saddle-node-like, community-level bistability. Small stochastic increases in neuronal load or transient astrocytic stress can push a local neuron\u2013astrocyte microcircuit across a separatrix into a low-energy/high-ROS attractor; hysteresis renders rescue impractical without anatomically implausible restoration of astrocytic capacity. This question is best addressed computationally by combining published neuron/astrocyte density, lactate-shuttle, glutathione/antioxidant flux, and dopamine-oxidation kinetics with spatially explicit ODE/PDE models and stochastic simulations.",

Empirical literature documents higher axonal/varicosity density and dopamine turnover in SNc vs VTA, astrocyte metabolic roles (lactate shuttle, glutathione cycling), and age-dependent decline in astrocytic function. However, existing models rarely integrate neuron\u2013astrocyte metabolic coupling and shared extracellular antioxidant limitations into a spatially structured tipping-point framework. This proposal differs by (i) treating astrocytes as finite, explicitly modeled metabolic/antioxidant resources shared across local neuronal populations, (ii) combining extracellular dopamine oxidation kinetics with glial ROS detoxification and lactate provisioning, and (iii) asking whether community-level allocation constraints produce qualitatively different bifurcation geometry (neighborhood collapse, synchronized failure, critical neighborhood size) and intervention strategies than single-cell models. It is not a trivial extension because shared buffering introduces network-level feedbacks, spatial correlation, and distinct intervention levers (boost glial capacity vs reduce neuronal demand) that change thresholds and rescue possibilities.",

We propose that the topology of neuron\u2013glia metabolic interdependence creates a community-level tipping point: dense dopaminergic terminals in SNc impose both high energetic demand and substantial extracellular oxidative burden due to dopamine autoxidation; nearby astrocytes supply lactate and antioxidant (glutathione-related) capacity that is finite and shared among many terminals. Using published anatomical (neuron and astrocyte densities, axonal/varicosity counts), physiological (firing rates, dopamine release/clearance, extracellular oxidation kinetics), and metabolic parameters (astrocytic lactate production rates, glutathione turnover, age-related decline estimates), we will build a spatially explicit, minimal dynamical model in which neuronal energetic reserve (E_i) and astrocytic resource pools (L_j for lactate, G_j for glutathione equivalents) interact via local coupling. Cooperative or saturating astrocytic responses and nonlinear ROS-induced mitochondrial damage produce load-dependent bifurcations: increasing neuronal load or decreasing astrocyte capacity creates a saddle-node fold resulting in bistability where healthy and collapsed neighborhood states coexist. Stochastic fluctuations can trigger transitions; hysteresis makes post-collapse rescue hard without restoring astrocyte capacity beyond practicable anatomical limits. We will analyze deterministic bifurcations, run stochastic ensemble simulations on realistic microcircuit geometries (using published densities and diffusion lengthscales), perform sensitivity analysis to rank intervention targets, and produce quantitative predictions linking local astrocyte:neuron ratios and dopamine turnover to collapse probability. The framework predicts that SNc neighborhoods lie closer to the tipping boundary than VTA, explains synchronized local degeneration patterns, and suggests glia-targeted interventions (boosting astrocytic antioxidant flux or lactate provision) as potentially higher-leverage than purely neuronal strategies.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "Differences in mitochondrial network dynamics (fusion vs fission balance and size-dependent mitophagy) create a dynamical tipping point: SNc neurons' high calcium pacemaking and long axons transiently bias fusion, producing large, interconnected mitochondrial networks that (a) spread ROS and mutant mtDNA, (b) blunt selective mitophagy, and (c) drive cooperative loss of OXPHOS function via a saddle-node bifurcation. VTA neurons avoid collapse because their mitochondrial dynamics keep the network in a fragmentation-dominated regime where damaged mitochondria are segregated and removed. This question is best addressed computationally because published quantitative rates for fusion/fission, mitophagy selectivity, transport, and calcium-driven modulation exist and can be integrated into stochastic, network-resolved models to reveal emergent topological transitions not visible in lumped energetic models.",

Prior theoretical work modeled whole-cell energetic bistability, arbor topology/percolation, proteostatic allocation, and mtDNA clonal expansion. However, none have modeled the intracellular mitochondrial network as an explicit dynamical graph with stochastic fusion/fission, size-dependent clearance, and activity-modulated rates to ask whether network topology itself undergoes a bifurcation that confers selective vulnerability. This proposal differs meaningfully by focusing on mitochondrial network topology and its regulation as the primary mechanism converting physiological pacemaking and structural load into a tipping point. It is not a trivial extension because fusion\u2013fission network dynamics produce different thresholds, separatrix geometries, and intervention targets (modulating DRP1/OPA1 kinetics, mitophagy size thresholds) than lumped energy or proteostasis models.",
        "Abstract": "Selective degeneration of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease remains unexplained by single-factor hypotheses. We propose that the emergent topology of the mitochondrial network\u2014set by stochastic fusion and fission dynamics, size-dependent mitophagy, and activity-dependent modulation\u2014creates a dynamical tipping point that renders SNc neurons uniquely vulnerable. High-frequency calcium pacemaking and extensive axonal demand transiently bias fusion (via calcium-sensitive OPA1/mitofusin regulation) and increase mitochondrial encounters in long arbors, promoting formation of large, interconnected mitochondrial reticula. These large structures dilute selective quality control: damaged mtDNA, oxidized proteins, and ROS can spread across the reticulum while mitophagy preferentially removes smaller, isolated fragments. We develop a literature-anchored stochastic network model in which discrete mitochondrial units (nodes) undergo fusion/fission, transport between soma and axon, size-dependent mitophagy, and activity-modulated fusion propensity. Mathematical and simulation analyses show that increasing pacemaking-driven fusion or effective encounter rates (scaled by axonal arborization) drives a load-induced saddle-node bifurcation: a healthy fragmented regime coexists with a pathological hyperfused regime characterized by high mutant load, low selective clearance, and collapsed ATP output. In parameter regimes calibrated from published fusion/fission kinetics, mitophagy selectivity, transport rates, and calcium-dependence, SNc-like ensembles fall inside the bistable band while VTA-like ensembles remain safely fragmented. Noise from transient insults or burst activity readily pushes SNc trajectories across the separatrix; hysteresis explains practical irreversibility.

Published single-cell and morphological datasets contain the empirical joint-distribution needed to locate a 'vulnerability axis' along which rare neurons (the distribution tail) sit close to an energetic saddle-node bifurcation. Small, population-level shifts in mean or variance with age (or increased trait correlations) produce abrupt increases in the fraction of neurons that stochastically tip into energetic collapse. This is best addressed computationally by learning the empirical multivariate trait distribution from published single-cell transcriptomics, reconstructions, and physiology summaries, mapping latent axes onto parameters of a minimal dynamical energetic model, and running population-level stochastic bifurcation simulations to quantify how covariance structure shapes population-scale risk.",
        "Related Work": "Prior work has identified many candidate causes of SNc vulnerability (large axonal arbors, calcium pacemaking, mitochondrial dysfunction, proteostatic stress) and shown that nonlinear mitochondrial dynamics can produce atomic bistability/tipping at the single-cell level. Other proposals focused on arbor topology/percolation, allocation of proteostatic flux, mtDNA dynamics, mitochondrial fusion/fission, or astrocytic buffering. However, most models treat cell types by mean parameter differences or single dominant mechanisms. Empirical single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq studies and recent morphological reconstructions reveal substantial cell-to-cell heterogeneity and covariance among risk-related traits. This proposal differs by (i) explicitly leveraging published multimodal population distributions to infer a vulnerability axis (a latent combination of traits), (ii) demonstrating that covariance \u2014 not just marginal means \u2014 determines the prevalence of cells near the tipping point, and (iii) linking population-level shifts (aging, inflammation) to sudden increases in collapse incidence. This is not a trivial extension: manipulating covariance can have outsized, non-additive effects (rare-event amplification) that qualitatively alter predictions and intervention priorities compared to single-parameter bifurcation models.",
        "Abstract": "Selective degeneration of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic neurons is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but why anatomically and molecularly similar ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons largely survive remains unresolved. We propose that selective vulnerability reflects a multivariate tail phenomenon: the joint distribution of many modest risk traits (axonal arborization, autonomous calcium entry, mitochondrial maintenance gene expression, proteostasis capacity) contains a latent 'vulnerability axis' along which rare neurons reside precariously close to an energetic saddle-node bifurcation. Using only published data, we will (1) assemble multimodal summary statistics and single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq datasets for midbrain dopaminergic neurons and morphological reconstructions, (2) learn low-dimensional latent axes (CCA, PCA, probabilistic factor analysis) that combine molecular, physiological and anatomical features and quantify the empirical covariance structure, (3) map latent scores into parameters of a compact two-variable energetic model (mitochondrial functional mass and energetic reserve) via literature-grounded regression priors, and (4) simulate population ensembles under stochastic perturbations and aging-driven shifts in distribution moments to compute population-level first-passage times and abrupt increases in collapse incidence. We will show that (i) SNc populations have heavier tails along the vulnerability axis than VTA due to specific trait covariances, (ii) modest shifts in mean or increases in trait correlations with age can nonlinearly amplify the vulnerable tail fraction, and (iii) interventions that decorrelate risk traits or reduce variance can be more effective per unit effort than single-parameter interventions that change means. This framework explains selective vulnerability, variability in age of onset, and sudden clinical progression as emergent consequences of population-level geometry in phenotype space, and yields concrete, data-grounded predictions and intervention priorities that can be tested by mapping new measurements onto the learned vulnerability axis.",

Identify the principal latent axis that loads positively on risk features (large axon proxy, high calcium-channel expression) and negatively on protective features (high mitophagy/biogenesis gene scores).

Testing this requires integrating published homeostatic plasticity kinetics, electrophysiological setpoints, energetic cost-per-spike, and mitochondrial aging data into a dynamical control model\u2014something only feasible with literature-derived data and computational analysis, not simpler static comparisons.",
        "Related Work": "Empirical work documents SNc vs VTA differences (axonal arbors, pacemaking calcium, mitochondrial fragility) and many theoretical models propose energetic bistability, proteostatic allocation, or arbor-topology percolation as tipping mechanisms. Separately, the neuroscience literature establishes robust homeostatic plasticity mechanisms (synaptic scaling, intrinsic excitability regulation) that maintain firing-rate setpoints on slow timescales (Turrigiano and colleagues). Prior PD-relevant models have not coupled explicit homeostatic controllers to cellular energetics and mitochondrial decline. This proposal differs by treating homeostatic regulation as an active feedback controller that (i) adapts on intermediate timescales, (ii) modifies energetic demand as a function of perceived functional error, and (iii) can therefore drive a neuron into a bifurcation that would not occur in the absence of adaptation. Unlike prior ideas, maladaptive homeostasis provides a mechanistic explanation for gradual compensation followed by abrupt failure and proposes distinct intervention levers (controller gain, setpoint, timescale) that are different from reducing static load or boosting clearance alone.",
        "Abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are preferentially lost in Parkinson's disease while neighboring ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons survive. Existing mechanistic accounts emphasize axonal load, calcium stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, often cast as static risk factors or as mechanisms producing single-cell bistability. Here we propose a complementary, control-theoretic explanation: neuronal homeostatic plasticity\u2014synaptic scaling and intrinsic excitability regulation that maintain firing-rate setpoints\u2014acts as a feedback controller that becomes maladaptive under chronic structural and energetic stress. As mitochondrial capacity declines with age, the controller compensates by increasing gain (e.g., boosting excitability or upscaling synapses) to maintain output. This compensation increases calcium entry and spiking-related energy use, accelerating mitochondrial damage and creating a positive feedback loop that drives the system through a load-induced saddle-node bifurcation into a collapsed low-energy state. We construct a minimal three-variable dynamical model (mitochondrial capacity M, energetic reserve E, homeostatic gain G) parameterized from published electrophysiology, homeostatic plasticity kinetics, Pissadaki & Bolam-style energetic cost estimates, and mitochondrial aging literature. Mathematical bifurcation analysis and stochastic simulations show that (i) controller adaptation creates a delayed tipping behavior (long compensation/prodrome, then rapid collapse), (ii) SNc-like parameter ensembles lie closer to the bifurcation than VTA-like ensembles because of larger effective load and different controller sensitivities, and (iii) modulating controller parameters (reducing gain, lowering setpoint, slowing adaptation) can be more effective than equivalently sized reductions in static load. This framework reframes PD vulnerability as an emergent failure mode of homeostatic regulation and yields empirically testable, literature-grounded predictions about which measurable changes (e.g., altered excitability setpoints, expression of homeostatic molecules) indicate proximity to tipping.",

Produce probabilistic priors for all key parameters.",
            "2) Minimal control-theoretic model construction: implement a compact ODE model with three core variables: M(t) mitochondrial functional capacity, E(t) energetic reserve/ATP available, and G(t) homeostatic gain controlling effective firing-related demand. Example form: dE/dt = production(M,E) - Demand(G,A,C,E); dM/dt = biogenesis(M,E) - damage(Demand,ROS)*M; dG/dt = (1/\u03c4)[K*(r_target - r_eff(E, G, A)) - lambda*G] where r_eff is effective firing/output (function of intrinsic excitability G and homeostatic scaling), K is controller gain, \u03c4 its timescale, lambda baseline decay.

Identify saddle-node folds, hysteresis width, and parameter regimes where adaptation shifts system into bistability. Analyze how changing controller parameters moves the bifurcation point and alters basin geometry.",

Where possible, test feasibility by re-analyzing published electrophysiology or transcriptomic summary statistics to see if SNc neurons show signatures consistent with higher homeostatic gain/load.",

Mitigation: use wide priors, sensitivity analysis, and emphasize qualitative behaviors (existence of controller-driven bifurcation) rather than exact ages.",
            "2) Model abstraction of homeostatic mechanisms: synaptic scaling and intrinsic excitability are implemented here as simplified control laws; molecular signaling complexity (transcriptional programs, neuromodulators) is abstracted. The aim is to capture generic control feedbacks and their dynamical consequences; future work could add molecular layers if warranted.",
            "3) Multiple interacting mechanisms: homeostatic maladaptation may interact with proteostasis, mtDNA dynamics, fusion/fission, or astrocytic buffering\u2014mechanisms explored in other proposals. This model isolates control-loop effects; combined mechanisms could amplify or mitigate tipping and should be explored later.",
            "4) Mapping to available data: mapping modeled controller variables to concrete, published biomarkers (e.g., gene expression scores) may be noisy or indirect. We will propose several candidate proxies and test robustness across them, but empirical validation may require new targeted measurements.",
            "5) Intervention interpretability: proposals to 'reduce homeostatic gain' or 'lower setpoint' are mechanistically abstract and may be challenging to translate directly into safe biological interventions. The value here is in identifying control-theoretic levers (slower adaptation, lower firing setpoint) and quantifying their required effect sizes; experimental translation will require careful biological design and safety considerations."

Coupled nonlinear mitochondrial respiration produces a load- and supply-dependent saddle-node bifurcation: when anatomical and age-related vascular constraints reduce local supply below a topology-dependent threshold, neurons enter a bistable regime where physiological noise triggers stochastic, hysteretic energetic collapse. This hypothesis can be tested purely computationally by combining published microvascular and metabolic summary statistics with diffusion-reaction and compartmental energetic models\u2014offering a distinct vascular-centric mechanism complementary to neuron-intrinsic and glial models and producing falsifiable, quantitative predictions about vascular metrics that control vulnerability.",

Pissadaki & Bolam and follow-ups quantified axonal energetic cost; other studies implicate mitochondrial dysfunction and calcium stress. Separately, literature in neurovascular physiology provides capillary density, oxygen diffusion coefficients, and local cerebral metabolic rate estimates. However, models linking microvascular geometry and perfusion reserve to single-neuron energetic tipping are scarce. This proposal differs by centering microvascular supply geometry as the primary bifurcation control parameter, integrating spatial oxygen/glucose diffusion-reaction PDEs with nonlinear mitochondrial respiration and axonal demand distributions. Unlike astrocytic-buffering or arbor-percolation models, the vascular microdomain mechanism predicts specific anatomical vascular metrics (local capillary spacing, perfusion heterogeneity, reserve fraction) that determine the existence and location of a bistable band, and yields different intervention targets (augment perfusion reserve, microvascular remodeling) whose predicted effect sizes are quantifiable from published data.",

Using published measures of capillary density, intercapillary distance, cerebral blood flow variability, oxygen diffusion constants, and neuronal energetic costs, we will build a spatial diffusion-reaction model of tissue oxygen/glucose coupled to a minimal nonlinear mitochondrial respiration/energetic-reserve model distributed across realistic axonal arbor geometries. Deterministic bifurcation analysis and stochastic simulations will determine conditions for bistability, first-passage times to collapse under physiological noise and age-related vascular decline, and hysteresis (practical irreversibility) due to anatomical constraints on increasing local perfusion or pruning axons. Mapping literature-derived SNc and VTA vascular and anatomical parameter ensembles into phase space predicts that SNc neurons occupy a bistable band while VTA neurons remain monostable. The model yields falsifiable quantitative predictions: critical capillary spacing and perfusion-reserve thresholds, required percent increases in local blood flow to avert tipping, and differential vulnerability across species and brain regions.

SNc neurons, with dense varicosities and particular firing burst statistics, lie in parameter regimes where transport-demand resonance yields recurrent deep ATP troughs that stochastically push the cell across a separatrix into irreversible energetic collapse\u2014while VTA neurons avoid these resonant regimes. This hypothesis is best tested computationally by integrating published transport kinetics, vesicle-release/cost statistics, and dopamine oxidation/ROS rates into compartmental stochastic transport\u2013supply\u2013demand models and analyzing temporal bifurcations (resonance tongues, Floquet-like instabilities) and stochastic first-passage behavior.",

Prior models either (i) treat neurons as temporally lumped energy units (static load vs recovery bifurcations), (ii) examine spatial percolation along arbors with transport limits, or (iii) study mitochondrial network dynamics, proteostatic allocation, or mtDNA stochasticity. None explicitly analyze how the temporal statistics of mitochondrial transport (run/pausing times, intermittent anterograde flux) interact with stochastic synaptic demand patterns (Poisson or bursty release, correlated bursts) to produce resonant depletion events and temporal bifurcations. This proposal differs by focusing on time-scale mismatch and resonance: slow, intermittent replenishment can synchronize poorly with fast, correlated demand to create recurrent deep ATP troughs whose cumulative damage induces tipping. The mechanism is not a trivial extension of spatial percolation or lumped bistability because temporal coherence and transport scheduling produce distinct resonance phenomena (Arnold-tongue\u2013like domains, Floquet instabilities) and different intervention strategies (altering transport time scales or firing temporal statistics) that are both measurable and manipulable.",

Structural load and mitochondrial dysfunction explain much, but they do not account for how physiologically plausible temporal patterns of supply and demand produce long prodromes followed by rapid collapse. We propose a novel, literature-grounded computational mechanism: a timescale mismatch and stochastic resonance between slow, intermittent mitochondrial transport/redistribution and fast, bursty synaptic ATP demand creates temporal bifurcations that precipitate irreversible energetic collapse. Leveraging published mitochondrial transport kinetics (velocities, run lengths, pausing), varicosity densities, vesicle-release statistics and ATP cost-per-release, calcium transient energetics, and dopamine oxidation/ROS generation rates, we will construct a compartmental, stochastic model along realistic axonal arbors in which discrete mitochondria move, pause, and exchange while local ATP pools are consumed by stochastic release events and calcium handling. Deterministic reductions and Floquet-style analysis identify resonant parameter bands (timing 'tongues') where periodic or correlated inputs synchronize demand to create deep ATP troughs; stochastic simulations show these troughs increase likelihood of crossing a damage-dependent separatrix into a collapsed attractor. Using literature-derived SNc vs VTA parameter ensembles, we predict that SNc neurons lie inside resonance domains where physiologic noise suffices to trigger collapse and hysteresis makes rescue impractical. The theory yields falsifiable, quantitative predictions about how modifying transport kinetics, altering firing burst statistics, or redistributing varicosities changes collapse risk.

In brain regions with dense dopaminergic terminal fields (SNc) this slowed clearance allows cooperative extracellular accumulation that accelerates local mitochondrial damage and proteostatic overload, driving a load-induced saddle-node bifurcation and bistability in neuronal energetic state. VTA regions, with lower extracellular source density and different interstitial geometry, remain safely monostable. This systemic sleep-to-clearance pathway uniquely links prodromal sleep disturbances in PD to later, rapid, and effectively irreversible cellular collapse and is testable by integrating published glymphatic, aggregation and neuronal energetic data into spatial reaction\u2013diffusion plus dynamical-system models.",

Prior computational proposals focused on neuron-intrinsic energetic tipping (axon load, mtDNA, proteostatic allocation), astrocytic buffering of ROS/lactate, or spatial percolation along arbors.

We hypothesize that sleep-regulated glymphatic clearance of extracellular proteopathic/molecular wastes (\u03b1\u2011synuclein oligomers, dopamine oxidation products, ROS byproducts) crucially modulates local extracellular load in regions with dense dopaminergic terminals. Aging and sleep fragmentation reduce glymphatic flux, slowing interstitial solute removal; in SNc microdomains this permits cooperative accumulation that feeds back to accelerate mitochondrial damage and proteostatic burden. Coupling literature-derived glymphatic flow rates, diffusion coefficients, aggregation/clearance kinetics, and neuronal energetic-bistability models, we will build spatial reaction\u2013diffusion PDE models of extracellular solute dynamics around realistic terminal-field geometries and link them to a minimal two-variable neuronal energetic model (mitochondrial functional mass M, energetic reserve E) that admits a saddle-node bifurcation under increased extracellular-mediated damage. Deterministic continuation locates sleep-dependent bifurcation folds; stochastic simulations quantify first-passage collapse probabilities under physiologically plausible sleep fragmentation profiles and age-dependent decline of clearance. We predict that modest reductions in nocturnal glymphatic flux (within reported sleep-disorder magnitudes) can move SNc ensembles into a bistable band, such that normal physiological noise suffices to trigger collapse; hysteresis makes rescue by later restoring sleep insufficient unless glymphatic flux is boosted beyond anatomically implausible levels.

Choose simple nonlinear recovery (cooperative biogenesis) so the system can undergo a saddle-node bifurcation as damage increases.

            "1) Data sparsity on glymphatic metrics in SNc: high-resolution, region-specific measures of glymphatic flux and interstitial clearance for midbrain (SNc vs VTA), especially in humans, are limited. We will mitigate by using cross-species priors, conservative uncertainty bands, and sensitivity analyses; focus on qualitative phase-structure rather than precise numeric thresholds.",
            "2) Simplified extracellular chemistry: extracellular aggregation and oxidative chemistry are complex (multiple species, membrane interactions). The model intentionally reduces these to minimal cooperative kinetics that capture bistability; different kinetic kernels may shift quantitative results. We will test multiple aggregation/clearance kernels to ensure robustness of the main topological conclusion.",

We will explore alternate coupling kernels (distance weighting, varicosity-driven coupling) and assess sensitivity.",
            "4) Overlap with astrocytic mechanisms: astrocytes participate in interstitial clearance and ROS detoxification; while conceptually distinct from an astrocyte-buffering model, the mechanisms interact. Positive results will motivate integrated astrocyte\u2013glymphatic follow-ups; negative results may reflect missing astrocytic detail rather than absence of effect.",
            "5) Translational interpretation: predicted effect sizes to avert tipping (e.g., percent increase in glymphatic flux) may be challenging to achieve clinically. The project aims to quantify required magnitudes to inform realistic experimental/interventional priorities rather than claim immediate therapeutic feasibility.",
            "6) Alternative explanations: PD is multifactorial; glymphatic impairment may be one of several converging risk factors. The model will therefore be careful to present glymphatic-driven tipping as a plausible, testable contributor, and will propose discriminative predictions (linking measured sleep metrics to local extracellular accumulation and energetic risk) to differentiate it from purely cell-autonomous hypotheses."

        "Short Hypothesis": "Long-range retrograde trophic signaling (e.g., GDNF/BDNF) from striatal target fields to nigral somata is finite and must be shared among many terminals; cooperative receptor signaling and transport delays create a load-dependent saddle-node bifurcation in a neuron\u001fs survival axis. SNc neurons, with vastly larger terminal fields and greater dependency on retrograde support, sit inside a bistable band where stochastic drops in trophic flux or transport efficacy cause terminal loss that irreversibly reduces trophic uptake (hysteresis), driving energetic/structural collapse. This mechanism explains selectivity, slow prodrome, and practical irreversibility, and is testable using published terminal-field reconstructions, measured trophic secretion/uptake kinetics, and transport rates without new wet-lab work.",
        "Related Work": "Empirical literature shows that dopaminergic neuron survival depends on target-derived neurotrophic factors (GDNF, BDNF) delivered retrogradely; retrograde transport deficits and reduced trophic signaling have been implicated in Parkinson\u001fs disease. Anatomical studies quantify enormous nigrostriatal arborization in SNc compared to VTA. Prior computational proposals have focused on cell-autonomous energetic load, mitochondrial dynamics, proteostasis, astrocytic buffering, or axonal percolation of mitochondrial failure. Few models explicitly treat target-derived trophic supply, receptor-cooperative survival signaling, and retrograde transport as the primary control parameter. This proposal differs by (i) centering retrograde trophic flux and its finite, spatially-distributed supply and uptake as the explicit bifurcation driver, (ii) including cooperative receptor/ signaling amplification (Hill kinetics) and transport delays that generate saddle-node bistability and hysteresis, and (iii) analyzing competition among neurons for limited trophic resources in the target field (a population-selection effect). Unlike simple energetic-load models, trophic-transport tipping identifies distinct intervention levers (increase target secretion, improve transport efficiency, or reduce terminal demand) and explains why late supplementation often fails unless anatomically implausible terminal restoration occurs.",
        "Abstract": "Selective degeneration of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson\u001fs disease contrasts with relative preservation of neighboring ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. While mitochondrial stress, calcium burden, and synucleinopathy have been implicated, a parsimonious explanation linking long-term resilience to target-derived trophic support is underexplored. We propose a minimal, literature-grounded dynamical theory: striatal-derived trophic factors (e.g., GDNF/BDNF) are produced at finite rates, taken up at numerous dopaminergic varicosities, and conveyed retrogradely to the soma via transport processes with limited capacity. Receptor-mediated survival signaling is cooperative, so somatic signaling and maintenance of axonal terminals depend nonlinearly on the aggregate trophic flux returning to the soma. Combining published data on terminal-field size and density, trophic secretion and receptor kinetics, and axonal transport velocities, we show analytically and numerically that increasing terminal-field load or decreasing trophic flux/transport produces a load-induced saddle-node bifurcation: healthy and atrophied steady states coexist over a band of effective loads. SNc neurons, having huge terminal fields and long transport times, map inside this bistable band where physiologic noise or modest declines in trophic supply (aging, target pathology) can stochastically drive them across the separatrix into a collapsed attractor with lost terminals and suppressed retrograde signaling. Hysteresis renders rescue by later trophic augmentation ineffective unless terminal field is anatomically restored. The theory unifies selective vulnerability, long prodromal phases, and practical irreversibility as consequences of geometric distance from a trophic tipping point and yields quantitative, testable predictions about required changes in trophic production or transport efficiency to delay or reverse collapse. All model code, curated parameter priors from the literature, and mapping scripts will be released to enable experimental follow-up.",

Build probabilistic priors for each parameter from meta-analysis of the literature.",
            "2) Minimal two-compartment ODE model (single-neuron): construct a compact dynamical model with variables: T_soma (somatic survival signaling level, proportional to retrograde trophic flux arriving at soma) and A_term (effective preserved axonal terminal mass/number). Core equations: dA/dt = growth_biogenesis(T_soma) - loss_due_to_energy_demand(A,aging); dT_soma/dt = transport_input(A,field_conc) * transport_efficiency - decay(T_soma).

High axonal/cellular demand (A,C) in SNc dopaminergic neurons places them inside a narrow bistable band where physiological noise or modest NAD+ depletion can trigger irreversible energetic collapse; VTA neurons remain in a monostable safe regime.

What is missing is a focused topological theory placing the NAD+/NADH redox couple\u2014the cell's core metabolic currency\u2014at the center of the bifurcation geometry. Prior work treats NAD+ largely as a therapeutic target (nicotinamide precursors) or as part of biochemical cascades; we will instead ask whether realistic, literature-supported rates of NAD+ decline and NAD+-dependent cooperative mitochondrial recovery generically produce saddle-node folds that separate SNc vs VTA vulnerability. This differs from past models by (a) elevating redox reserve as the primary slow variable coupled to mitochondrial biogenesis control, (b) using published metabolite and enzyme-expression summaries to map cell types into phase space, and (c) deriving quantitative predictions about required NAD-restorative effect sizes (e.g., nicotinamide riboside dosing equivalents) to move neurons out of bistability.",
        "Abstract": "Selective degeneration of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson\u0002s disease remains poorly explained despite implicating axonal load, calcium stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and proteostatic failure.

NAD+ drives sirtuin-dependent activation of mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1\u03b1 axis) and is consumed by energetic and repair processes; conversely, mitochondrial function sustains NAD+ regeneration. High structural (axon arbor A) and ionic (calcium pacemaking C) demand increases NAD+ consumption and pushes the system toward a fold bifurcation. We will assemble published metabolomic, transcriptomic (NAMPT, SIRT, PGC-1\u03b1), and physiological summary statistics to parameterize plausible SNc- and VTA-like ensembles. Deterministic bifurcation analysis will identify bistable bands and hysteresis; stochastic simulations will compute first-passage collapse probabilities under physiologically plausible NAD+ decline and transient insults. We predict SNc neurons map inside a narrow bistable band where modest NAD+ depletion or transient increased demand triggers irreversible-like collapse, whereas VTA neurons remain in a deep monostable basin. The model yields concrete, testable predictions: how much increase in NAD+ synthesis/precursors, sirtuin activation, or modest firing-rate reduction is required to avert tipping, and whether timing of NAD-restorative therapy matters given hysteresis.

SNc neurons occupy Pareto-optimal points that maximize population-level broadcast/coverage at the expense of energetic margin; aging-driven reductions in mitochondrial capacity or clearance shift these optimized designs across a topological bifurcation (saddle-node) into an irreversible collapsed state. Mapping published morphologies, electrophysiology, and metabolic data onto a Pareto front plus a minimal energetic dynamical model will explain why SNc\u2014but not VTA\u2014neurons are both highly optimized for function and catastrophically fragile late in life. This framing leverages only published datasets and in silico optimization/analysis and is the most direct way to link evolutionary design pressures to observed selective vulnerability without requiring new experiments.",

What is novel here is (i) an explicit multi-objective optimization framing\u2014using Pareto/frontier analysis and evolutionary life-history constraints\u2014to explain why SNc neurons evolved to sit near a fragile design edge, (ii) a quantitative pipeline that maps published morphological and physiological measurements onto objective axes and computes distance-to-frontier and distance-to-tipping simultaneously, and (iii) cross-species life-history integration (lifespan vs design trade-offs) to explain vulnerability differences.

We propose that SNc neurons are the product of evolutionary multi-objective optimization: maximizing dopamine broadcast reach and release reliability across the striatum while minimizing wiring/maintenance cost. These competing objectives place SNc neurons near the Pareto front of feasible designs, i.e., at high functional payoff but with low energetic margin. We hypothesize that aging-related declines (mitochondrial capacity, proteostatic flux) shift the biophysical parameters of these optimal designs across a saddle-node bifurcation, creating a bistable regime where physiological fluctuations can produce irreversible energetic collapse. To test this we will (1) assemble published single-neuron reconstructions, varicosity counts, firing/pacemaking statistics, and metabolic summaries (mitochondrial density, turnover estimates) for SNc and VTA across species; (2) define interpretable objective functions\u2014coverage (effective territory/varicosity reach), signal fidelity (release reliability per unit cost), and metabolic cost (energy per signal) grounded in Pissadaki & Bolam-style energetics and electrophysiology summaries; (3) run multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to compute Pareto fronts in design parameter space (axon length, varicosity density, baseline firing, calcium load) under physiological constraints; (4) map real neurons onto this front, measure Pareto distance and which trade-offs they exploit; (5) couple the design coordinates to a minimal two-variable energetic dynamical model (mitochondrial capacity M and energetic reserve E) known to exhibit a saddle-node fold, and study how aging-like parameter drifts move Pareto-optimal designs across bifurcation boundaries; (6) perform stochastic simulations to compute first-passage collapse probabilities; and (7) explore cross-species life-history predictions (longer-lived species should favor safer designs or earlier compensatory changes). The result will be a testable, quantitative theory that unifies why SNc neurons were 'designed' for high function yet sit precariously close to a topological tipping point, yielding concrete predictions about which measurable design axes (e.g., varicosity per unit length, firing duty cycle) most determine vulnerability and how modest interventions shift distance-to-tipping.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "The joint action of multiple moderate stressors (e.g., sleep fragmentation/glymphatic decline, transient inflammation, increased calcium load, proteostatic burden, mild mitochondrial loss) can produce qualitatively different outcomes depending on their temporal ordering: early hits that reconfigure slow control variables (proteostatic capacity, mitochondrial reserve, NAD+ redox) open vulnerability windows that make later hits far more likely to trigger a saddle-node collapse. Thus, selective SNc vulnerability and variable prodromal timing reflect path-dependent trajectories through neuronal phase space rather than only aggregate burden. This question is best addressed computationally by combining published effect-size estimates and time-course data with minimal dynamical models and stochastic ensembles to identify sequence-sensitive dangerous orders and optimal timing for interventions.",
        "Related Work": "Many prior computational and conceptual studies have shown that neuronal energetic systems can be bistable (saddle-node folds) and that factors such as axonal load, calcium pacemaking, mitochondrial dynamics, proteostatic allocation, mtDNA clonal expansion, glial buffering, and vascular limits influence vulnerability. Empirical literature documents the variety of subtle, age-dependent insults (sleep loss, inflammation, mitochondrial decline, \u0003-synuclein seeding) associated with PD. However, existing models largely study single dominant drivers or simultaneous parameter shifts; they do not systematically study the nonlinear, path-dependent interaction between multiple time-varying stressors. This proposal differs by explicitly asking whether the temporal sequence of plausible, literature-grounded insults qualitatively alters collapse probability, timing, and hysteresis geometry \u2014 a nontrivial, mechanistic question because slow variables and hysteresis can render order-of-events decisive. It extends prior bistability and tipping-point work by embedding realistic temporally structured perturbations, performing sequence-space exploration, and deriving control-theoretic intervention timing recommendations grounded in published effect sizes.",
        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease features a long, variable prodrome and then a relatively rapid, often irreversible loss of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic neurons. Multiple modest insults \u2014 sleep fragmentation, low-level neuroinflammation, cumulative mitochondrial decline, increased calcium-driven demand, impaired proteostasis, and extracellular aggregate seeding \u2014 are implicated in PD, but it is unclear why their combinations produce highly variable, often abrupt outcomes. We propose that path dependence in neuronal phase space, shaped by slow control variables and hysteresis, makes the order and timing of subthreshold stressors critical: early perturbations that reduce slow reserves (mitochondrial capacity, proteostatic flux, redox pools) reposition the system nearer a saddle-node fold, so later, otherwise innocuous insults produce irreversible collapse. To test this, we will build a compact, literature-anchored dynamical model (few slow variables: mitochondrial functional mass M, proteostatic reserve P, aggregate burden A, redox reserve N, plus a fast energetic reserve E) whose nonlinearities admit saddle-node bifurcations and hysteresis. Using published time-course and effect-size priors for representative stressors (sleep/glymphatic decline, low-grade inflammation, L-type calcium upregulation, alpha-synuclein seeding, NAD+ decline), we will exhaustively sample sequence space, run stochastic ensembles, and compute first-passage statistics and basin geometries. We will identify 'high-risk sequences' (orders and timing windows that greatly increase collapse probability), quantify how much earlier interventions need to be applied to be effective, and derive robust early-warning temporal biomarkers. All inputs (effect-size priors) will come from published studies; analyses will combine deterministic continuation, stochastic simulation, global sensitivity, and optimal-control computations to produce falsifiable, actionable predictions about which early stressors are most dangerous and when to intervene. Code and curated parameter ensembles will be released to enable experimental mapping of specific cohorts onto a sequence-sensitive 'distance-to-tipping' metric.",

Include mechanistic couplings grounded in literature: demand increases with pacemaking and axonal load, aggregates increase mitochondrial damage and proteostatic drain, NAD+ drives mitochondrial biogenesis, proteostatic flux is finite and shared, and cooperative mitochondrial recovery allows saddle-node folds.

This paper uses only published datasets and modeling to test whether human/pathology data provide quantitative evidence for a tipping-point topology underlying selective vulnerability.",
        "Related Work": "Many computational models have proposed forward mechanisms producing neuronal energetic bistability (mitochondrial cooperative recovery, proteostatic allocation, axonal topology). Empirical literature provides cross-sectional and age-stratified measures: stereological SNc neuron counts vs age/PD stage, mtDNA deletion fractions in aged nigral neurons, Braak staging and \u0003-synuclein burden summaries, and imaging markers (DAT-SPECT) showing non-linear decline. Prior work has not attempted a principled inverse approach to infer dynamical topology from these population-level statistics. Our approach differs by (a) treating observed cross-sectional variability as the stationary / transient output of an age-dependent stochastic dynamical system, (b) using Fokker-Planck / likelihood-based and ABC inference to recover dynamical parameters and test for bistability and hysteresis, and (c) leveraging multiple, heterogeneous published datasets in a hierarchical framework to constrain topology rather than parameters of any single forward mechanism. This is not a trivial extension: inferring topology (existence and location of folds) from population histograms under noise and aging is a novel methodological contribution and provides empirical constraint on many forward models.",
        "Abstract": "Selective degeneration of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease has been argued to result from load-dependent nonlinear failures (saddle-node bifurcations) in cellular energetics. Numerous mechanistic forward models show such topology is plausible, but the question remains: do existing human and animal pathology datasets actually contain evidence for bistability and hysteresis at the population level? We propose an inverse, data-driven program to answer this. We will assemble published, age-stratified summary statistics and digitized curves: stereological SNc neuronal counts by age and disease stage, proportions of respiratory-chain-deficient neurons and mtDNA deletion burdens, regional \u0003-synuclein pathology prevalence, and in vivo imaging decline trajectories (DAT-SPECT/PET) where available. We will build a minimal stochastic dynamical model of an effective neuronal energetic state x(t) (fast/slow components abstracted) whose drift depends on age-dependent decline in maintenance and a nonlinear recovery term capable of producing saddle-node folds. Using analytical stationary solutions (Fokker-Planck) where possible and time-dependent stochastic simulations otherwise, we will compute the predicted cross-sectional distributions of x at different ages. We will then perform hierarchical Bayesian inference and likelihood-free inference (ABC-SMC) to fit model topology parameters (existence & location of folds, noise amplitude, aging drift) to the assembled datasets, comparing monostable vs bistable models via Bayes factors and posterior predictive checks. We will validate by predicting independent datasets (VTA counts, different cohorts), quantify the inferred separatrix and hysteresis width, and translate these topological estimates into practical intervention effect sizes (how much increasing maintenance or reducing load would be needed to move a typical SNc neuron out of the bistable band).

Phospholipid-remodeling (Lands cycle) and glutathione-dependent reduction provide a finite, slowly renewing membrane-repair capacity R that can be overwhelmed cooperatively: above a critical effective per-terminal LP production rate (set by varicosity density, firing, and extracellular oxidation), repair dynamics undergo a load-driven saddle-node bifurcation that generates bistability between a healthy, low-damage state and a high-damage, low-energy state. SNc neurons map inside the bistable band while VTA neurons remain monostable. Physiological noise or transient insults can stochastically push SNc trajectories across the separatrix into a membrane-damaged attractor; hysteresis prevents practical rescue unless membrane-repair capacity is increased well beyond physiologically plausible amounts. This hypothesis can be tested solely with published measurements (varicosity density, DA release/oxidation rates, lipid peroxidation kinetics, enzyme turnover/repair rates, GSH pool sizes) together with new dynamical and spatial modeling.",
        "Related Work": "Empirical literature documents selective SNc vulnerability, dense nigrostriatal arborization, autonomous pacemaking with substantial dopamine release, dopamine autoxidation and quinone formation, and evidence of lipid peroxidation and impaired antioxidant defenses in PD. Biochemically, phospholipid repair (the Lands cycle: phospholipase A2-mediated deacylation and acyltransferase re-acylation), glutathione-dependent reduction of lipid peroxides (GPx), and ferroptosis-related lipid damage pathways have been intensively studied. Prior computational proposals focused on energetic load, mitochondrial dynamics, axonal percolation, proteostatic allocation, mtDNA dynamics, glial buffering, vascular supply, trafficking resonance and other mechanisms, but none elevate membrane maintenance and phospholipid remodeling as the central slow control variable producing topological tipping. This proposal differs by (i) making membrane damage/repair the primary slow variable coupled to energetic reserve, (ii) using published lipid-peroxidation and repair kinetics plus anatomical/physiological varicosity data to quantitatively map SNc vs VTA into a bifurcation diagram, and (iii) predicting distinct intervention effect sizes (antioxidant replenishment vs boosting remodeling enzymes) that differ from purely mitochondrial or proteostatic strategies. It is not a trivial extension: membrane chemistry yields cooperative damage/repair nonlinearities and spatially distributed sources (terminals) that qualitatively change separatrix geometry and hysteresis compared to prior mechanisms.",
        "Abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) degenerate preferentially in Parkinson's disease while neighboring ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons are comparatively spared. Dopamine autoxidation, lipid peroxidation (LP), oxidative stress, and deficits in antioxidant and lipid remodeling pathways have been reported in PD, but a simple, quantitative mechanism explaining selective vulnerability and irreversible collapse is lacking. We propose that the balance between per-terminal LP production and cellular phospholipid-repair capacity constitutes a slow, topological control axis. Using published measurements (varicosity/axon densities, DA release and extracellular oxidation kinetics, LP chain-propagation rates, GPx/GSH dynamics, PLA2/ACSL/LPCAT enzyme kinetics and turnover), we build a minimal dynamical model coupling membrane damage D(t) and repair capacity R(t) to cellular energetic reserve E(t). Cooperativity arises because LP accelerates production of further reactive lipid species and impairs repair enzyme function, while low E reduces ATP-dependent re-acylation flux. We show analytically and numerically that increasing effective terminal load produces a load-induced saddle-node bifurcation and a bistable band: a healthy low-D/high-R attractor coexists with a pathological high-D/low-R attractor. Mapping literature-derived SNc and VTA parameter ensembles into phase space places SNc inside the bistable band with shallow energetic basins, explaining stochastic escape under physiological noise. Hysteresis renders rescue by later antioxidant therapy or modest energy boosts impractical unless repair capacity is dramatically increased. The membrane-repair tipping perspective unifies dopamine oxidation, lipid peroxidation signatures, and the practical irreversibility of late-stage degeneration, and yields quantitative, testable predictions for intervention effect sizes and biomarker thresholds.

        "Short Hypothesis": "A slow, self-reinforcing epigenetic feedback \u2014 activity- and metabolism-dependent chromatin remodeling that downregulates mitochondrial maintenance programs \u2014 converts transient energetic stress into a long-lived transcriptional 'lock-in' that produces a saddle-node bistability and practical irreversibility in vulnerable SNc neurons. This mechanism is distinct from purely metabolic or proteostatic tipping because the slow chromatin state acts as a dynamical memory that amplifies small energetic deficits into persistent loss of mitochondrial recovery capacity. The hypothesis is best addressed by integrating published epigenetic, single-cell transcriptomic, and metabolic summary data into a minimal dynamical model (mitochondrial capacity M, energetic reserve E, chromatin activation H) and testing whether literature-derived parameter ensembles place SNc but not VTA neurons inside a bistable band where transcriptional lock-in enables stochastic escape and hysteresis.",
        "Related Work": "Prior modeling has explained selective SNc vulnerability via axonal load, mitochondrial bistability, proteostatic allocation, mtDNA dynamics, glial buffering, or NAD+ redox decline. Empirical studies document activity- and metabolism-sensitive chromatin regulation (acetyl-CoA and NAD+-dependent histone modifications), age- and PD-associated changes in transcription of mitochondrial/mitophagy genes, and single-cell RNA-seq/ATAC-seq datasets from midbrain cell types showing differential regulation. However, existing tipping models either treat gene regulation as a static parameter (e.g., lower biogenesis rates) or focus on metabolic variables alone (e.g., NAD+). This proposal differs by making a compact, slow epigenetic state H the explicit dynamical variable that (i) controls expression of mitochondrial maintenance programs cooperatively, (ii) is modulated by cellular energetic/metabolic signals (acetyl-CoA, NAD+, ROS, calcium), and (iii) exhibits self-reinforcement (histone modification maintenance, chromatin compaction), thus producing topological bistability and hysteresis. This is not a trivial extension: including a slow transcriptional memory changes the geometry of basins, timing of prodrome-to-collapse transitions, and intervention windows (early epigenetic reprogramming vs late metabolic rescue).",
        "Abstract": "Selective loss of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson\u0002s disease contrasts with sparing of ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons. Energetic load, calcium stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, proteostatic failure, and NAD+ decline have all been implicated, yet none fully explains why brief insults can lead to long-lived, effectively irreversible cellular collapse. We propose an epigenetic-lock-in tipping hypothesis: activity- and metabolism-sensitive chromatin modifications (histone acetylation/methylation, chromatin accessibility) constitute a slow, self-reinforcing variable H that governs the transcription of mitochondrial biogenesis/quality-control genes. Transient energetic deficits reduce acetyl-CoA/NAD+-dependent chromatin activation, lowering expression of maintenance programs and degrading mitochondrial capacity M; because H is maintained on long timescales (epigenetic memory), reduced H further impairs recovery, producing positive feedback. A minimal three-variable dynamical model (M: mitochondrial functional mass; E: fast energetic reserve; H: chromatin activation) parameterized from published metabolic, epigenetic, and single-cell transcriptomic/ATAC-seq summary statistics generically exhibits a load-induced saddle-node bifurcation: SNc-like parameter ensembles map into a bistable band where a healthy high-M/high-H attractor coexists with a collapsed low-M/low-H attractor. Stochastic simulations show physiologically plausible noise and transient insults can drive SNc trajectories across the separatrix; hysteresis makes post-collapse metabolic rescue ineffective unless chromatin state is reprogrammed beyond realistic limits. We will calibrate model priors using published assays (histone mark changes with age/activity, expression of PGC-1\u0003a and mitophagy genes, acetyl-CoA/NAD+ proxies), perform bifurcation and sensitivity analyses, and produce falsifiable predictions about timing and magnitude of epigenetic-targeted interventions (HDAC inhibition, acetyl-CoA boosting) needed to avert or reverse collapse.

Evaluate where empirical ensembles fall relative to bifurcation boundaries.",

            "5) Predictive translation limitations: while the model can predict required effect sizes for epigenetic or metabolic interventions, translating pharmacological doses from reported molecular effect sizes to in vivo neuronal chromatin shifts is complex. We will carefully compare modeled effect sizes to reported molecular changes (e.g., fold-change in H3K27ac after HDAC inhibitors) and report uncertainties, not clinical prescriptions.",

These statistical early-warning signals are detectable in published in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology datasets (SNc vs VTA, aging and PD models) and can be combined with a minimal two-timescale dynamical model to (i) infer proximity to tipping for populations and (ii) generate falsifiable biomarkers for preclinical intervention. This approach is best addressed computationally by re-analyzing published spike-train data and linking observed statistical changes to a literature-parameterized energetic model rather than by new wet-lab experiments.",
        "Related Work": "Prior PD vulnerability models focus on cellular energetics, axonal arbor load, proteostatic limits, mitochondrial network dynamics, and topological bifurcations producing bistability and hysteresis. Separately, neuroscience literature on early-warning signals of critical transitions (critical slowing down) demonstrates that approaching bifurcations produces increased variance and autocorrelation in observables; some work has applied these ideas to population neural signals (LFP/EEG) and network states but not systematically to single-unit spike trains tied to cellular energetic tipping. Existing SNc vs VTA studies document differing firing patterns, pacemaking variability, and age- or toxin-induced changes in electrophysiology (Surmeier lab, others), and some papers provide publicly accessible spike-train data (or link repositories). What is new here is (i) combining a minimal, literature-anchored, two-timescale energetic-spiking model that predicts precise changes in spike-train statistics as a neuron approaches an energetic saddle-node fold, (ii) systematically re-analyzing published single-unit spike-train datasets (SNc vs VTA, aging cohorts and PD models) for early-warning markers, and (iii) using Bayesian/likelihood frameworks to map observed spike statistics to a probabilistic distance-to-tipping metric. This differs from past models because it (a) makes directly testable, data-grounded predictions about observable electrophysiological biomarkers, (b) uses only published datasets and modeling, and (c) yields practical early-detection tools experimentalists can apply without new invasive assays.",
        "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease features a long prodromal phase followed by relatively rapid loss of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic neurons. Theoretical work suggests that nonlinear energetic feedbacks (mitochondrial cooperative recovery, proteostatic allocation) can create saddle-node bifurcations and bistability, explaining irreversibility and selective vulnerability. Dynamical systems theory predicts that approaching such bifurcations produces critical slowing down and characteristic changes in fast-timescale observables. We propose to (i) derive quantitative predictions from a compact two-timescale model that couples fast spike generation to a slow energetic reserve variable and (ii) test those predictions by re-analyzing published single-unit spike-train datasets from SNc and VTA neurons across aging and PD-model studies. The model shows that as the slow energetic variable drifts toward a fold, spike trains should exhibit increased variance, rising autocorrelation (lag-1), heavier-tailed interspike interval distributions (increased skew/kurtosis), elevated low-frequency power (flattened spectral slope), and longer recovery times from perturbations. We will compile and harmonize published electrophysiology datasets (in vivo anesthetized/awake recordings, ex vivo slices, genetic/toxin models, age series) and compute a battery of time-series early-warning statistics in sliding windows. Using approximate-likelihood and Bayesian inversion, we will map observed statistics onto model-derived distance-to-tipping posteriors and compare SNc vs VTA distributions and age-/model-dependent trends. We will also simulate realistic noise and heterogeneity ensembles to compute expected false-positive/false-negative rates and propose robust detection thresholds.

Choose forms so nondimensionalized control parameter (effective load L = f(A,C,...) / biogenesis_capacity) produces a saddle-node fold in the (E,r) reduced dynamics.

This collective spike-time alignment can push an otherwise-subthreshold ensemble of neurons into a correlated, high-demand episode that triggers a network-amplified saddle-node energetic collapse; VTA populations, being less tightly coupled or less densely packed, avoid this collective tipping. Published reports of intermittent SNc synchrony, gap-junction/field-coupling markers, and electrophysiological coherence metrics suffice to parameterize and falsify this mechanism computationally without new wet-lab data.",

Several proposed models address population-level effects via shared astrocytic/metabolic pools, but none focus on neuronal electrical/field coupling as the driver of synchronous, network-scale demand surges that transiently amplify per-cell load and generate collective bifurcation geometry. Separately, electrophysiology literature reports episodes of correlated firing and altered coherence in midbrain dopaminergic populations (in vivo and slice), and molecular studies report expression of connexins and other coupling mediators in midbrain neurons. This proposal differs by (i) treating synchrony as a dynamical, emergent control parameter that can create a collective saddle-node-like fold absent at single-cell level, (ii) integrating published coupling/coherence statistics and anatomical density metrics to ground coupling strengths and encounter probabilities, and (iii) combining mean-field bifurcation analysis with network-level stochastic simulations and re-analysis of published spike-train datasets to test whether synchrony precedes energetic failure signatures. It is not a trivial extension of prior temporal-resonance or astrocyte-community models because electrical/field coupling produces rapid, transient global alignment of fast demand events across many cells and thereby changes the topology (width and depth of basins, hysteresis) of the aggregate system.",
        "Abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are lost preferentially in Parkinson's disease while ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons are comparatively resistant. Most mechanistic accounts focus on cell-autonomous factors (axonal load, calcium pacemaking, mitochondrial fragility) or shared metabolic buffering (astrocytes). We propose an orthogonal, computationally testable mechanism: emergent network synchrony among SNc pacemaking neurons transiently aligns calcium entry and release-driven ATP consumption across many cells, producing collective high-demand episodes that push the ensemble past a load-induced saddle-node bifurcation into a collapsed energetic state. Key features: (i) coupling modalities (electrical gap junctions, ephaptic interactions in dense terminal fields, correlated volume-transmission input) are parameterized from published expression and electrophysiology studies; (ii) each neuron carries a slow mitochondrial/energetic state variable that integrates demand and recovers nonlinearly, allowing single-cell bistability in marginal cases; (iii) fast-timescale synchrony raises effective instantaneous demand multiplicatively across the network, creating a genuinely collective fold that appears at network scale even when isolated neurons would be safe. We will assemble literature priors for coupling strengths, coherence statistics, firing/burst distributions, and anatomical density, then analyze a family of coupled stochastic pacemaker-energetic models using mean-field reductions, bifurcation continuation, and large-scale stochastic simulation on anatomically-informed network graphs. We will re-analyze publicly available midbrain spike-train datasets to test whether transient increases in synchrony correlate with signatures of critical slowing or later pathology markers. The model predicts specific falsifiable signatures: (a) synchronized episodes that precede collapse, (b) a non-linear dependence of collapse probability on coupling strength and network size, and (c) higher leverage of desynchronizing interventions (gap-junction blockers, mild decorrelation of inputs) than equivalent reductions in single-cell demand.

            "2) Heterogeneous recording conditions: published spike-train datasets vary in anesthesia, behavioral state, and species which can confound synchrony metrics. Mitigation: careful metadata curation, within-study contrasts (SNc vs VTA where available), hierarchical statistical models, and surrogate controls to bound inference.",
            "3) Mechanistic ambiguity: synchrony may be a correlate rather than a driver of pathology (e.g., both could be driven by a third factor). This computational program seeks to test sufficiency and plausibility, not to claim causality from existing cross-sectional data. We will propose falsifiable predictions (interventions that desynchronize should lower collapse probability in silico) to guide experimental tests.",
            "4) Model abstraction: the synchrony amplification function (how coincident spikes supra-linearly increase effective ATP cost) is a modeling choice with uncertain exponent/shape. Mitigation: explore families of amplification kernels (linear, sub/superlinear, saturating) and show which qualitative results persist.",
            "5) Translation to human PD: even if synchrony-driven tipping is mechanistically plausible, its relative contribution to human PD pathogenesis alongside proteostatic, mitochondrial, and glial mechanisms may be modest. The goal is to establish plausibility bounds and generate discriminative experimental signatures to evaluate the mechanism empirically.",
            "6) Computational cost: large ensembles of stochastic network simulations with many neurons and long simulated lifespans can be demanding. We'll use mean-field guidance to focus high-resolution simulations on critical parameter regimes and employ efficient event-driven implementations and parallelization compatible with standard lab computational resources."
